# Full Text Search
FullTextSearch works by extending the default `ExternalIndex` in Umbraco with its own fields for full text content. It renders nodes using your desired rendering method. Full Text Search comes with two methods, one fetching the node using a HttpClient (default), and one using Umbracos own `RenderTemplate` method. The rendered content is then indexed in the `ExternalIndex`.

The rendered content of nodes is cached in a seperate database table, so rendering can be skipped when reindexing Examine. FullTextSearch listens to events from the `ContentCacheRefresher`, and updates its own cache upon the `CacheUpdated` event.

## Installation
Install using the nuget package.
This package requires Umbraco 10.0 as a minimum version, and is tested against 10.x, 11.x, 12.x and 13.x.

## Configuration
You can configure FullTextSearch in your appsettings.json, like
```json
{
  "Umbraco": {
    "FullTextSearch": {
      "DefaultTitleField": "searchResultTitle",
      "DisallowedContentTypeAliases": [ "verySecretContent" ],
      "DisallowedPropertyAliases": [ "hideInSearch" ],
      "Enabled": true,
      "FullTextPathField": "MyCustomPathField",
      "FullTextContentField": "MyCustomContentField",
      "HighlightPattern": "<span class=\"bold\">{0}</span>",
      "RenderingActiveKey": "HiEverybody!",
      "XPathsToRemove": [ "//script" ]
    },
  }
}

```

The package comes with a schema for your appsettings, to enable Intellisense in the IDE of your choice. You can also configure in your startup like this:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddUmbraco(_env, _config)
        .AddBackOffice()
        .AddWebsite()
        .AddDeliveryApi()
        .AddFullTextSearch(options =>
        {
            options.DefaultTitleField = "title";
            options.DisallowedContentTypeAliases = new List<string> { "verySecretContent" };
            options.DisallowedPropertyAliases = new List<string> { "hideInSearch" };
            options.Enabled = true;
            options.FullTextPathField = "MyCustomPathField";
            options.FullTextContentField = "MyCustomContentField";
            options.HighlightPattern = "<span class=\"bold\">{0}</span>";
            options.RenderingActiveKey = "HiEverybody!";
            options.XPathsToRemove = new List<string>() { "//script" };
        })
        .AddComposers()
        .Build();
}
```

Note, you don't need to add `.AddFullTextSearch(` in your startup, unless you want to configure it from there. If not added - a composer will take care of adding it for you, using the configuration from appsettings.json - or the default config.

FullTextSearch config comes with a [default config, you can see it here](/src/Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch/Options/FullTextSearchOptions.cs)

Here is an overview of the different config settings you can add.

### Indexing
Indexing the full text content is by default enabled, but you can disable it by setting `Enabled` to false.

#### Default Title Field
The `DefaultTitleField` node contains the name of the field containing the title of the page in the index. The default value is `nodeName`. You can also override this when searching.

#### Disallowed Aliases
By default, all nodes with a template will be cached and indexed. You can control which nodes are being indexed, by adding the aliases of their Content Types, or the alias of a checkbox property on the nodes to exclude them from this.

The disallowed property aliases can be used to create your own "umbracoNaviHide" for FullTextSearch. Add a boolean property to your document type, and reference its alias in this setting. If the node has that property set to true, it will be excluded from full text indexing.

Adding to this config on a site already indexed doesn't clean the index. You have to do this manually - but the search will exclude nodes of the disallowed types for you.

By default, no content types or property aliases is disallowed.

#### Rendering
By default rendering is performed by fetching the node using a HttpClient, and storing the output as the full text search content.

The default `HttpPageRenderer` requires your website to be able to browse itself. Depending on your setup, this is sometimes not possible. We've opted to use this approach, as it makes sure that it will render your pages exactly how your users access them. Thus giving the exact content as expected.

If you are in a situation, where you can't use the HttpClient, a simpler `RazorPageRenderer` is bundled with the package. This uses Umbracos built in `RenderTemplate` function, and renders the node in it's template. However - this method doesn't use any route hi-jacking, but simply sends the `IPublishedContent` representation of the node to the nodes view for rendering.

To enable the `RazorPageRenderer` (or any other renderer you might code yourself), change the registration of `IPageRenderer`, eg. in Startup.cs:

```cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // omitted...

    services.AddUnique<IPageRenderer, RazorPageRenderer>();
}
```

##### Modifying HttpClient of HttpPageRenderer
If you need to customize the HTTP-request by adding headers or cookies you can also override our named HttpClientFactory to set default values:

```csharp
var cookieContainer = new CookieContainer();
cookieContainer.Add(new Cookie("custom-cookie", "hallo-world", "/", "localhost"));

services.AddHttpClient(FullTextSearchConstants.HttpClientFactoryNamedClientName, c => {

    c.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("custom-header","H5YR");

})
.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(x => new HttpClientHandler()
{
    AllowAutoRedirect = false, // Important to keep this to avoid indexing pages where HTTP-status is not OK
    CookieContainer = cookieContainer
});
```

For example, if you are working locally and are getting this type of error: `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestException: The SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception.` You can add an appSettings.json value on your local environment:

```json
...
 "SiteSettings": {
        "CurrentEnvironment": "Local",
        "IgnoreHttpSslErrors": true
    }
...
```
and update Startup.cs with the following:

```csharp
// Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch HttpClient 
var ignoreSSL = _config.GetSection("SiteSettings").GetSection("IgnoreHttpSslErrors").Value != null && bool.Parse(_config.GetSection("SiteSettings").GetSection("IgnoreHttpSslErrors").Value);
services.AddHttpClient(FullTextSearchConstants.HttpClientFactoryNamedClientName, c =>
{
   //your custom config as needed
})
.ConfigurePrimaryHttpMessageHandler(_ =>
{
    var ftsHandler = new HttpClientHandler();
	if (ignoreSSL)
	{
		ftsHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback +=
			(sender, certificate, chain, errors) =>
			{
				if (ignoreSSL) return true;
				return errors == SslPolicyErrors.None;
			};
	}
    ftsHandler.AllowAutoRedirect = false; // Important to keep this to avoid indexing pages where HTTP-status is not OK
    return ftsHandler;
});
```


##### Controlling what content is indexed
When rendering, FullTextSearch adds the value of `RenderingActiveKey` as the value of a Request header named `X-Umbraco-FullTextSearch`, so you can use that to send different content to the renderer. The default value is FullTextRenderingActive. You can also use the `IsRenderingActive` helper method, in your views, to determine whether or not FullTextSearch is rendering the page. You can use this to exclude parts of the views from the content being rendered/indexed.

```cshtml
@inject Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch.Helpers.FullTextSearchHelper FullTextSearchHelper

@if (FullTextSearchHelper.IsRenderingActive()) {
    <div>This content is only visible when FullTextSearch is rendering the page for indexing</div>
}
```

##### XPaths to remove
In addition to the RenderingActiveKey, you can also add specific Xpaths to remove from the rendered content. Using this, you can ie. remove scripts (`//script`) or the head area ('//head') of the page.

By default no XPaths are removed.

#### Examine Field Names
Full Text Search works by extending the default `ExternalIndex` in Umbraco. Fields containing the full text content, and a searchable path to the node is added. By default these fields are called FullTextContent, and FullTextPath, but if you need them to be something else (like, if you had Umbraco properties using those aliases), you can change it in this config section.

## Searching

### The clean way
The preferred way of searching is by using the `ISearchService` interface. Below is the simplest possible example of a controller for a search node.
```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewEngines;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch.Interfaces;
using Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch.Models;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Web;
using Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.Controllers;
using Umbraco.Extensions;

namespace MyProject.Controllers
{
    public class SearchController : RenderController
    {
        private readonly ISearchService _searchService;

        public SearchController(ISearchService searchService, ILogger<RenderController> logger, ICompositeViewEngine compositeViewEngine, IUmbracoContextAccessor umbracoContextAccessor) : base(logger, compositeViewEngine, umbracoContextAccessor)
        {
            _searchService = searchService;
        }

        public override IActionResult Index()
        {
            if (Request.Query.ContainsKey("q"))
            {
                int.TryParse(Request.Query["p"].ToString(), out int currentPage);
                currentPage = currentPage < 1 ? 1 : currentPage;

                var search = new Search(Request.Query["q"].ToString())
                    .SetCulture(CurrentPage.GetCultureFromDomains().ToLower());

                ViewBag.FullTextSearchResult = _searchService.Search(search, currentPage);
            }
            return CurrentTemplate(CurrentPage);
        }
    }
}
```
In this example I add `ISearchService` as a dependency for the controller. `ISearchService` performs the searching, and takes a `Search` object, which can be configured in numerous ways. The result is then added to the `ViewBag`. Notice that you need to set the culture of the search in order to get results from the right fields. Also notice the `Request.Query["p"]` and `Request.Query["q"]` variables used for paging and getting search terms.

My preferred way of searching looks like this:

```
using Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch.Interfaces;

namespace Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.PublishedModels
{
    public partial class Search
    {
        public IFullTextSearchResult FullTextSearchResult { get; set; }
    }
}
```
First I extend the model of my search page from ModelsBuilder, by adding a partial class, and adding the `IFullTextSearchResult` property.


```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ViewEngines;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Options;
using Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch.Interfaces;
using Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch.Models;
using Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch.Options;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Web;
using Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.Controllers;
using Umbraco.Extensions;
using ContentModels = Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.PublishedModels;

namespace MyProject.Controllers
{
    public class SearchController : RenderController
    {
        private readonly ISearchService _searchService;
        private readonly FullTextSearchOptions _options;

        public SearchController(ISearchService searchService, IOptions<FullTextSearchOptions> options, ILogger<RenderController> logger, ICompositeViewEngine compositeViewEngine, IUmbracoContextAccessor umbracoContextAccessor) : base(logger, compositeViewEngine, umbracoContextAccessor)
        {
            _searchService = searchService;
            _options = options.Value;
        }

        public override IActionResult Index()
        {
            var searchModel = CurrentPage as ContentModels.Search;

            if (Request.Query.ContainsKey("q"))
            {
                int.TryParse(Request.Query["p"].ToString(), out int currentPage);
                currentPage = currentPage < 1 ? 1 : currentPage;

                var search = new Search(Request.Query["q"].ToString())
                    .EnableHighlighting()
                    .AddTitleProperty("metaTitle")
                    .AddTitleProperty("nodeName")
                    .AddSummaryProperty("metaDescription")
                    .AddSummaryProperty(_options.FullTextContentField)
                    .SetSummaryLength(160)
                    .SetPageLength(10)
                    .SetCulture(CurrentPage.GetCultureFromDomains().ToLower());

                searchModel.FullTextSearchResult = _searchService.Search(search, currentPage);
            }
            else
            {
                searchModel.FullTextSearchResult = null;
            }
            return CurrentTemplate(searchModel);
        }
    }
}

```
Here I also include `IOptions<FullTextSearchOptions>` as a dependency, enabling me to get different keys from the config in my configuration. I then add a new property (`FullTextSearchResult`) to my generated model from ModelsBuilder, where I can put my search results. As you can see, the `new Search()` part is now configured in more detail. See what you can configure further below.

On this search, I enable highlighting of text in the output by using `EnableHightling()`, I then configure it to use `metaTitle` and `nodeName` as fields for getting the title of each page (that way `nodeName` is used, if `metaTitle` is empty or doesn't exist). I configure it to use `metaDescription` or the default text field for the summary. And then I set the summary length to be 160 characters (the default is 300), and the pagelength to be 10 results per page (the default is 0, meaning no pagination will occur). Lastly I set the culture, to make FullTextSearch look for results with the same culture as the request.

### The easy way
By injecting the FullTextSearch helper into your view, you can search directly from your Razor view. The simplest possible way of doing that, is by simple adding the following to your view:

```
@inject Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch.Helpers.FullTextSearchHelper FullTextSearchHelper
@{
    var searchResult = FullTextSearchHelper.Search("putYourSearchTermHere");
}
```

The Search helper method takes either a string searchTerm, and an optional culture string, or a `Search` object, like demonstrated in the controllers above. In addition to that, you can specify which page of the search results you want to show. By default, the first page will be shown, but if you wan't paging you need to implement that by your self. Feel free to take inspiration from the controllers.


## Rendering the search results
When rendering you work with the `IFullTextSearchResult` value, that you either got using a controller or the helper method. The code sample below shows how to use it from the ModelsBuilder extension, but `Model.FullTextSearchResult` could also have been `ViewBag.FullTextSearchResult` or simply `searchResult` following the examples above.

```
@if (Model.FullTextSearchResult != null)
{
    <ul>
        @foreach (var result in Model.FullTextSearchResult.Results)
        {
            <li>
                <a href="@result.Content.Url()">@result.Title</a>
                <p>
                    @result.Summary
                </p>
                <small>
                    Url: @result.Content.Url()<br />
                    Id: @result.Id<br />
                    Last updated: @(result.Content.UpdateDate)<br />
                    Score: @result.Score
                </small>
            </li>
        }
    </ul>

    <div>Total results: @Model.FullTextSearchResult.TotalResults</div>

    if (Model.FullTextSearchResult.CurrentPage > 1)
    {
        <a href="?q=@Context.Request.Query["q"].ToString()&p=@(Model.FullTextSearchResult.CurrentPage-1)">Previous page</a>
    }

    if (Model.FullTextSearchResult.CurrentPage < Model.FullTextSearchResult.TotalPages)
    {
        <a href="?q=@Context.Request.Query["q"].ToString()&p=@(Model.FullTextSearchResult.CurrentPage+1)">Next page</a>
    }
}

```

Model.FullTextSearchResults now contains the result object (`IFullTextSearchResult`), in which the following properties is available:

`long TotalPages`
The total number of search result pages.

`long CurrentPage`
The current search result page being viewed.

`long TotalResults`
The total number of search results.

`IEnumerable<ISearchResultItem> Results`
A list of results on the current page.

Each result is an `ISearchResultItem` with the following properties:

`string Id`
The id of the node.

`double Score`
The score given by Lucene to the result. The higher the better.

`IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string> Fields`
The fields on the item in Examine

`string Title`
The title generated by FullTextSearch according to your title properties.

`IHtmlString Summary`
The summary generated by FullTextSearch according to your summary properties and summary length.

`IPublishedContent Content`
The IPublishedContent for the search result.

## Configuring the search
The search service takes a `Search` object, which can be configured fluently in numerous ways. You create one by writing `new Search(string searchTerm)`, and from there you can add the following configuration:

`AddTitleProperties(string[] aliases)` or `AddTitleProperty(string alias)`
Adds field names to use for title properties. Note, that this overrides the config setting, so you need to add all wanted fields for titles here.

`RemoveTitleProperties(string[] aliases)` or `RemoveTitleProperty(string alias)`
This removes field names to use for title properties. Note that the default title properties from config is only used if no other title properties are set in the search. So you don't have to remove the default and add another if you want to swap.

`AddBodyProperties(string[] aliases)` or `AddBodyProperty(string alias)`
Adds field names to use for body properties. Note, that this overrides the config setting, so you need to add all wanted fields for bodytext here.

`RemoveBodyProperties(string[] aliases)` or `RemoveBodyProperty(string alias)`
This removes field names to use for bodyproperties. Note that the default body properties from config is only used if no other body properties are set in the search. So you don't have to remove the default and add another if you want to swap.

`AddSummaryProperties(string[] aliases)` or `AddSummaryProperty(string alias)`
Adds field names to use for summary properties. Note, that if you don't specify any summary properties, the body properties will be used instead.

`RemoveSummaryProperties(string[] aliases)` or `RemoveSummaryProperty(string alias)`
This removes field names to use for summary properties.

`AddRootNodeIds(int[] ids)` or `AddRootNodeId(int id)`
With this setting, you can limit search results to be descendants of the input ids. This way you can make the search work on specific parts of your site.

`RemoveRootNodeIds(int ids)` or `RemoveRootNodeId(int id)`
Removes already set root node ids from the search object.

`SetSummaryLength(int length)`
Sets the summary length in the results. The default is `300` characters.

`SetFuzzyness(double fuzzyness)`
Fuzzyness is used to match your search term with similar words. This method sets the fuzzyness parameter of the search. The default is `0.8`.

`EnableWildcards()` or `DisableWildcards()`
These enables or disables use of wildcards in the search terms. Wildcard characters are added automatically to each of the terms. Wildcards is disabled by default

`EnableHighlighting()` or `DisableHighlighting()`
These enables or disables search term highlighting in the search results. If enabled, search terms in the summary will be highlighted by adding `<b>` tags around them. Highlighting is disabled by default.

`SetPageLength(int length)`
This sets the desired page length of your search results. If you set it to 0, you will get all search results on the first page. The default value is 0.

`SetCulture(string culture)`
This is used to define which culture to search in. You should probably always set this, but it might work without it, in invariant sites.

`AddAllowedContentTypes(string[] aliases)` or `AddAllowedContentType(string alias)`
Adds Content Type aliases to the list of allowed Content Types, in order to limit the search to nodes of the specified Content Type Aliases. By default, nodes of all Content Types (except the ones that are disallowed) will be searched.

`RemoveAllowedContentTypes(string[] aliases)` or `RemoveAllowedContentType(string alias)`
Removes Content Type aliases from the list of allowed Content Types.

`SetContentOnly(bool contentOnly)`
By default, Full Text Search will only search for content (`__IndexType:content`). You can disable this behavior with this method.

`SetPublishedOnly(bool publishedOnly)`
By default, Full Text Search will only search for published content (`__Published:y`). You can disable this behavior with this method.

`SetRequireTemplate(bool requireTemplate)`
By default, Full Text Search will only search for content with a template (`NOT templateId:0`). You can disable this behavior with this method.

`SearchEverything()`
A combination of the above methods. This will disable searching for published content with a template only. This is useful if you want to use Full Text Search to search for other things like media or custom indexes.

`SetCustomQuery(string customQuery)`
This adds a custom query as a requirement for a search. Ie. if you need to filter out certain results based on other fields, like `myCustomField:"needs this content"` etc. The custom query is added to the end of the complete query, with an AND clause before.

`SetIndex(string index)`
Set which index to search. By default, Full Text Search will search in the built in External Index, but if you have content in another index you want to search - you can configure this here. Note, this only controls which index you are searching. Indexing is still only happening in the external index.

`SetSearcher(string searcher)`
Set which searcher to use for searching. By default, Full Text Search will use the searcher from the selected index (default: the built in External Index).

## Using Notifications
Full Text Search uses Notifications (similar to the Umbraco) to allow you to hook into the workflow process for the package. Currently the CacheService published notifications when new text is saved (or while saving) to the cache. The notifications are handled just like in [Umbraco](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/reference/notifications).

### CacheService Notifications
|Notification|Members|Description|
|-|-|-|
|CacheSavingNotification|<ul><li>IEnumerable&#x3C;CacheItem> SavedEntities</li><li>EventMessages Messages</li><li>IDictionary&#x3C;string,object> State</li><li>bool Cancel</li></ul>|<p>Published when the ICacheService.AddToCache is called in the API.<br>SavedEntities: The collection of CacheItem objects being saved.</p>|
|CacheSavedNotification|<ul><li>IEnumerable&#x3C;CacheItem> SavedEntities</li><li>EventMessages Messages</li><li>IDictionary&#x3C;string,object> State</li><li>bool Cancel</li></ul>|<p>Published when the ICacheService.AddToCache is called in the API and after data has been persisted.<br>SavedEntities: The collection of CacheItem objects saved.</p>|

## Debugging
For easier debugging, you can override the default log level for the package in `appsettings.json` like this:

```json
"Serilog": {
  "MinimumLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Override": {
      "Our.Umbraco.FullTextSearch": "Debug",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```
## Load-balanced setups
TL;DR When using the package in a load-balanced site, you need to be careful of disabling it for the public instances.

As explained in the [Rendering section](developers-guide-v4.md#rendering), Full Text Search uses Umbraco's `RenderTemplate` method to render the content, and be able to index it.

The problem with load-balanced scenarios, is that the `RenderTemplate` method needs an `HttpContext` to run. When we publish a page, we will use the Master site. Full Text Search will be able to use an available `HttpContext` because when we save we are actually in a http request so there is an `HttpContext`; but once the content have been saved, these changes will also trigger a content update in the Public instance. In this case, this update happens internally, triggered by Umbraco in the background, without a real http request. 

And without an http request we won't have an `HttpContext` and we will get an internal error similar to this:
```
FullTextSearch: Error updating nodeId: 11409 in culture:  using templateId: 3589: <!-- Error rendering template with id 11409: 'System.InvalidOperationException: HttpContext is null
	at Umbraco.Extensions.HttpContextAccessorExtensions.GetRequiredHttpContext(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
   	at Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.Templates.TemplateRenderer.ExecuteTemplateRendering(TextWriter sw, IPublishedRequest request)
   	at Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.Templates.TemplateRenderer.RenderAsync(Int32 pageId, Nullable`1 altTemplateId, StringWriter writer)
   	at Umbraco.Cms.Core.Templates.UmbracoComponentRenderer.RenderTemplateAsync(Int32 contentId, Nullable`1 altTemplateId)' -->
```

This error can actually make that the indexing is incorrect and will overwrite the right indexing done by your Master instance.

For this reason, you need to disable Full Text Search only in the Public instances.

To do this, you need wrap the Full Text Search initilization in some type of conditional that discriminates between your Public and your Master. Something like this:

```
if(isMaster)
{
    umbracoBuilder.AddFullTextSearch(options =>
          {
              options.DisallowedPropertyAliases = new List<string> { "umbracoNaviHide" };
              options.XPathsToRemove = new List<string> { "//script", "//style", "//iframe"" };
          });
 
    builder.Services.AddUnique<IPageRenderer, RazorPageRenderer>();
}
```
You have more information on how to discriminate them in the official [Umbraco documentation](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/setup/server-setup/load-balancing).
